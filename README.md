## 1. What is _Express.js_, and how does it relate to _Node.js_?

**Express.js** is a web application framework that runs on **Node.js**. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a range of powerful features, including robust routing, middleware support, and HTTP utility methods. Thanks to its modular design, you can expand its functionality through additional libraries and Node.js modules.

### Key Features

- **Middleware**: Express.js makes use of middleware functions that have access to the request-response cycle. This allows for a variety of operations such as logging, authentication, and data parsing.

- **Routing**: The framework offers a flexible and intuitive routing system, making it easy to handle different HTTP request methods on various URLs.

- **Templates**: Integrated support for template engines enables the dynamic rendering of HTML content.

- **HTTP Methods**: It provides built-in methods for all HTTP requests, such as `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, simplifying request handling.

- **Error Handling**: Express streamlines error management, and its middleware functions can specifically handle errors.

- **RESTful APIs**: Its features such as request and response object chaining, along with HTTP method support, make it ideal for creating RESTful APIs.

### Relationship with Node.js

Express.js is a web application framework specifically designed to extend the capabilities of **Node.js** for web development. Node.js, on the other hand, is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side and networking applications.

Express.js accomplishes this through a layer of abstractions and a more structured approach, which Node.js, by itself, doesn't provide out of the box.

### Code Example: Basic Express Server

Here is the Node.js code:

```javascript
// Import required modules
const express = require('express');

// Create an Express application
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a route and its callback function
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
});
```
<br>

## 2. Explain the concept of _middleware_ in _Express.js_.

**Middleware** acts as a bridge between incoming HTTP requests and your Express.js application, allowing for a range of operations such as parsing request bodies, handling authentication, and even serving static files.

### Middleware Functions

A middleware function in Express is a **handler invoked in sequence** when an HTTP request is received. It has access to the request and response objects, as well as the `next` function to trigger the next middleware in line.

Each middleware function typically follows this signature:

```javascript
function middlewareFunction(req, res, next) {
    // ...middleware logic
    next(); // or next(err); based on whether to proceed or handle an error
}
```

Note that the `next()` call is essential to move on to the next middleware.

### Types of Middleware

#### Application-Level Middleware

Registered via `app.use(middlewareFunction)`, it's active for every incoming request, making it suitable for tasks like request logging or establishing cross-cutting concerns.

#### Router-Level Middleware

Operates on specific router paths and is defined using `router.use(middlewareFunction)`. It's useful for tasks related to particular sets of routes.

#### Error-Handling Middleware

Recognizable via its function signature `(err, req, res, next)`, this type of middleware specifically handles errors. In the middleware chain, it should be placed after regular middlewares and can be added using `app.use(function(err, req, res, next) { ... })`.

#### Built-In Middleware

Express offers ready-to-use middleware for tasks like serving static files or parsing the request body.

### Middleware Chaining

By **sequentially** calling `next()` within each middleware, you form a chain, facilitating a cascade of operations for an incoming request.

Consider a multi-tiered security setup, for example, with authentication, authorization, and request validation. Only when a request passes through all three tiers will it be processed by the actual route handler.

### Code Example: Middleware Chaining

Here is the code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Sample middleware functions
function authenticationMiddleware(req, res, next) {
    console.log('Authenticating...');
    next();
}

function authorizationMiddleware(req, res, next) {
    console.log('Authorizing...');
    next();
}

function requestValidationMiddleware(req, res, next) {
    console.log('Validating request...');
    next();
}

// The actual route handler
app.get('/my-secured-endpoint', authenticationMiddleware, authorizationMiddleware, requestValidationMiddleware, (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome! You are authorized.');
});

app.listen(3000);
```
<br>

## 3. How would you set up a basic _Express.js_ application?

To set up a **basic Express.js** application, follow these steps:

### 1. Initialize the Project

Create a new directory for your project and run `npm init` to generate a `package.json` file.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install **Express** as a dependency using the Node Package Manager (NPM):
```bash
npm install express
```

### 3. Create the Application

In your project directory, create a main file (usually named `app.js` or `index.js`) to set up the Express application.

Here is the JavaScript code:

```javascript
// Import the Express module
const express = require('express');

// Create an Express application
const app = express();

// Define a sample route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### 4. Run the Application

You can start your Express server using Node.js:
```bash
node app.js
```

For convenience, you might consider using **Nodemon** as a development dependency which automatically restarts the server upon file changes.
<br>

## 4. What is the purpose of the `app.use()` function?

In Express.js, the `app.use()` function is a powerful tool for **middleware management**. It can handle HTTP requests and responses, as well as prepare data or execute processes in between.

### Key Functions

- **Global Middleware**: Without a specified path, the middleware will process every request.
- **Route-specific Middleware**: When given a path, the middleware will only apply to the matched routes.

### Common Use-Cases

- **Body Parsing**: To extract data from incoming requests, especially useful for POST and PUT requests.

  ```javascript
  const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
  app.use(bodyParser.json());
  ```

- **Handling CORS**: Useful in API applications to manage cross-origin requests.

  ```javascript
  app.use(function(req, res, next) {
      res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
      res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
      next();
  });
  ```

- **Static File Serving**: For serving files like images, CSS, or client-side JavaScript.

  ```javascript
  app.use(express.static('public'));
  ```

- **Logging**: To record request details for debugging or analytics.

  ```javascript
  app.use(function(req, res, next) {
      console.log(`${new Date().toUTCString()}: ${req.method} ${req.originalUrl}`);
      next();
  });
  ```

- **Error Handling**: To manage and report errors during request processing.

  ```javascript
  app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
      console.error(err);
      res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  });
  ```

### Chaining Middleware

You can **stack multiple middleware** using `app.use()` in the order they need to execute. For a matched route, control can be passed to the next matching route or terminated early using `next()`.
<br>

## 5. How do you serve _static files_ using _Express.js_?

In an Express.js **web application**, you often need to **serve static files** such as stylesheets, client-side JavaScript, and images. You can accomplish this using the `express.static` middleware.

### Middleware for Serving Static Files

The `express.static` middleware function serves static files and is typically used to serve assets like images, **CSS**, and **client-side JavaScript**.

Here is the code example:

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

In this example, the folder named `public` will be used to serve the static assets.

### Additional Configuration with Method Chaining

You can further configure the behavior of the `express.static` middleware by chaining methods.

For example, to set the cache-control header, the code looks like this:

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public', {
    maxAge: '1d'
}));
```

Here, the `'1d'` ensures that caching is enabled for a day.

### Using a Subdirectory

If you want to serve files from a subdirectory, you can specify it when using the `express.static` middleware.

Here is the code example:

```javascript
app.use('/static', express.static('public'));
```

This serves the files from the `public` folder but any requests for these files should start with `/static`.

### What `express.static` Serves

- **Images**: PNG, JPEG, GIF
- **Text Content**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Fonts**
- **JSON Data**

#### Not for dynamic content

While `express.static` is excellent for **static assets**, it's not suitable for dynamic content or data in **POST** requests.
<br>

## 6. Discuss the difference between `app.get()` and `app.post()` in _Express.js_.

In **Express.js**, `app.get()` and `app.post()` are two of the most commonly used HTTP method middleware. The choice between them (or using both) typically depends on whether you are **retrieving** or **submitting/persisting** data.

### Key Distinctions

#### HTTP Verbs: External Visibility

- **app.get()**: Listens for GET requests. Designed for data retrieval. Visible URLs typically trigger such requests (e.g., links or direct URL entry in the browser).

- **app.post()**: Listens for POST requests. Intended for data submission. Typically not visible in the URL bar, commonly used for form submissions.

#### Data Transmission

- **app.get()**: Uses query parameters for data transmission, visible in the URL. Useful for simple, non-sensitive, read-only data (e.g., filtering or pagination). 

- **app.post()**: Uses request body for data transmission, which can be in various formats (e.g., JSON, form data). Ideal for more complex data, file uploads, or sensitive information.

### Using Both `app.get()` and `app.post()` for the Same Route

There are cases, especially for **RESTful** design, where a single URL needs to handle both data retrieval and data submission.

- **Resource Retrieval and Creation**: 
   - **Fetch a Form**: Use `app.get()` to return a form for users to fill out.
   - **Form Submission**: Use `app.post()` to process and save the submitted form data.
- **Complete Entity Modification**: For a complete update (or replacement in REST), using `app.post()` ensures that the update action is triggered via a post request, not a get request. This distiction is important to obey the RESTful principles. 

### Code Example: Using both `app.get()` and `app.post()` for a single route

Here is the JavaScript code:
```javascript
const userRecords = {}; // in-memory "database" for the sake of example

// Handle user registration form
app.get('/users/register', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Please register: <form method="POST"><input name="username"></form>');
});

// Process submitted registration form
app.post('/users/register', (req, res) => {
    userRecords[req.body.username] = req.body;
    res.send('Registration complete');
});
```
<br>

## 7. How do you retrieve the _URL parameters_ from a _GET request_ in _Express.js_?

In **Express.js**, you can extract **URL parameters** from a **GET** request using the `req.params` object. Here's a quick look at the steps and the code example:

### Code Example: Retrieving URL Parameters

```javascript
// Sample URL: http://example.com/users/123
// Relevant Route: /users/:id

// Define the endpoint/route
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    // Retrieve the URL parameter
    const userId = req.params.id;
    // ... (rest of the code)
});
```

In this example, the URL parameter `id` is extracted and used to fetch the corresponding user data.

### Additional Steps for Complex GET Requests

For simple and straightforward **GET** requests, supplying URL parameters directly works well. However, for more complex scenarios, such as parsing parameters from a URL with the help of `querystrings` or handling optional parameters, **Express.js** offers more advanced techniques which are outlined below:

#### Parsing Query Parameters

- **What It Is**: Additional data passed in a URL after the `?` character. Example: `http://example.com/resource?type=user&page=1`.

- **How to Access It**: Use `req.query`, an object that provides key-value pairs of the parsed query parameters.

#### Code Example: Parsing Query Parameters

```javascript
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
    const { q, category } = req.query;
    // ... (rest of the code)
});
```

#### Optional and Catch-All Segments

- **Optional Segments**: URL segments enclosed in parentheses are optional and can be accessed using `req.params`. Example: `/book(/:title)`

- **Catch-All Segments**: Captures the remainder of the URL and is useful in cases like URL rewriting. Denoted by an asterisk (`*`) or double asterisk (`**`). Accessed using `req.params` as well. Example: `/documents/*`
<br>

## 8. What are _route handlers_, and how would you implement them?

**Route handlers** in Express.js are middleware functions designed to manage specific paths in your application.

Depending on the HTTP method and endpoint, they can perform diverse tasks, such as data retrieval from a database, view rendering, or HTTP response management.

### Code Example: Setting Up a Simple Route Handler

Here is the code:

```javascript
// Responds with "Hello, World!" for GET requests to the root URL (/)
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});
```

In this example, the route handler is `(req, res) => { res.send('Hello, World!'); }`. It listens for GET requests on the root URL and responds with "Hello, World!".

### What Are Route-Handler Chains?

You can associate numerous route-managing **middleware functions** to a single route. Every middleware function in the chain has to either proceed to the following function using `next()` or conclude the request-response cycle.

This allows for checks like user authentication before accessing a route.

### HTTP Method Convenience Methods

Express.js offers specialized, highly-readable methods for the most common HTTP requests:

- `app.get()`
- `app.post()`
- `app.put()`
- `app.delete()`
- `app.use()`

These methods streamline route handling setup.
<br>

## 9. How do you enable _CORS_ in an _Express.js_ application?

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing** (CORS) is a mechanism that allows web pages to make requests to a different domain. In Express.js, you can enable CORS using the `cors` package or by setting headers manually.

### Using the `cors` Package

1. **Install `cors`**:

   Use npm or yarn to install the `cors` package.

   ```bash
   npm install cors
   ```

2. **Integrate with Your Express App**:

   Use the `app.use(cors())` middleware. You can also customize CORS behavior with options.

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const cors = require('cors');
   const app = express();

   // Enable CORS for all routes
   app.use(cors());

   // Example: Enable CORS only for a specific route
   app.get('/public-data', cors(), (req, res) => {
       // ...
   });

   // Example: Customize CORS options
   const customCorsOptions = {
       origin: 'https://example.com',
       optionsSuccessStatus: 200 // Some legacy browsers choke on 204
   };

   app.use(cors(customCorsOptions));
   ```

### Manual CORS Setup

Use the following code example to **set CORS headers manually** in your Express app:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept');
    if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
        res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS');
        return res.status(200).json({});
    }
    next();
});
```

Make sure to place this middleware before your route definitions.
<br>

## 10. Explain the use of `next()` in _Express.js middleware_.

In Express.js, **middleware** functions are crucial for handling HTTP requests. A single request can pass through multiple middlewares before reaching its endpoint, providing opportunities for tasks like logging, data parsing, and error handling. The `next()` function is instrumental in this process, allowing for both regular middleware chaining and special error handling.

### What is `next()`?

- `next()`: A callback function that, when called within a middleware, passes control to the next middleware in the stack.
- `next()` is typically invoked to signal that a middleware has completed its tasks and that the request should move on to the next middleware.
- If a middleware doesn't call `next()`, the request flow can get **stuck**, and the subsequent middlewares won't be executed.

### Use-Cases

1. **Regular Flow**: Invoke `next()` to move the request and response objects through the middleware stack.
2. **Error Handling**: If a middleware detects an error, it can short-circuit the regular flow and jump directly to an error-handling middleware (defined with `app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {})`). This is achieved by calling `next(err)`, where `err` is the detected error.

### Code Example: Logging Middleware

Here is the code:

```javascript
const app = require('express')();

// Sample middleware: logs the request method and URL
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next(); // Move to the next middleware
});

// Sample middleware: logs the current UTC time
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(new Date().toUTCString());
    next(); // Move to the next middleware
});

app.listen(3000);
```

In this example, both middlewares call `next()` to allow the request to progress to the next logging middleware and eventually to the **endpoint** (not shown, but would be the next in the chain).

Without the `next()` calls, the request would get **stuck** after the first middleware.
<br>

## 11. What is the role of the `express.Router` class?

The `express.Router` is a powerful tool for **managing multiple route controllers**. It helps in organizing routes and their handling functions into modular, self-contained groups.

### Key Features

- **Modularity**: Rely on separate route modules for improved code organization, maintainability, and collaboration.

- **Middlewares**: Like the main `express` app, the router can also use middlewares to process incoming requests.

- **HTTP Method Chaining**: Simplifies route handling by allowing method-specific routes to be defined using method names.

#### Example: Middleware and Route Handling

Here is the Node.js code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Logger Middleware
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Router-specific Request Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});

// "GET" method route
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Router Home Page');
});

// "POST" method route
router.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Router Home Page - POST Request');
});

module.exports = router;
```

In this example, we:

- Utilize the built-in `express.Router`.
- Attach a general-purpose middleware and two different HTTP method-specific routes.
- The router is then integrated into the main `express` app using:

```javascript
const app = express();
const router = require('./myRouterModule');

app.use('/routerExample', router);
```

Here, `app.use('/routerExample', router);` assigns all routes defined in the router to `/routerExample`.
<br>

## 12. How do you handle _404 errors_ in _Express.js_?

**Handling 404 errors** in Express is essential for capturing and responding to requests for non-existent resources. You typically use both **middleware** and **HTTP response** mechanisms for this purpose.

### Middleware for 404s

1. Use `app.use` at the end of the middleware chain to capture unresolved routes.
2. Invoke the middleware with `next()` and an `Error` object to forward to the error-handling middleware.

Here is the Node.js code example:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const err = new Error(`Not Found: ${req.originalUrl}`);
    err.status = 404;
    next(err);
});
```

### Error-Handling Middleware for 404s and Other Errors

1. Define an error-handling middleware with **four** arguments. The first one being the `error` object.
2. Check the error's status and respond accordingly. If it's a 404, handle it as a not-found error; otherwise, handle it as a server error.

Here is the Node.js code:

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    const status = err.status || 500;
    const message = err.message || "Internal Server Error";

    res.status(status).send(message);
});
```

### Full Example: 

Here is the complete Node.js application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Sample router for demonstration
const usersRouter = express.Router();
usersRouter.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
    res.send('User Profile');
});
app.use('/users', usersRouter);

// Capture 404s
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const err = new Error(`Not Found: ${req.originalUrl}`);
    err.status = 404;
    next(err);
});

// Error-handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    const status = err.status || 500;
    const message = err.message || "Internal Server Error";
    res.status(status).send(message);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
<br>

## 13. What are the differences between `req.query` and `req.params`?

In Express.js, `req.query` is used to access **GET** request parameters, while `req.params` is used to capture parameters defined in the **URL path**.

### Understanding Express.js Routing

Express.js uses **app.get()** and similar functions to handle different types of HTTP requests.

- **app.get('/users/:id')**: Matches GET requests to `/users/123` where `123` is the `:id` parameter in the path.

### Accessing Request Data

- **req.query**: Utilized to extract query string parameters from the request URL. Example: For the URL `/route?id=123`, use `req.query.id` to obtain `123`.
- **req.params**: Used to retrieve parameters from the request URL path. For the route `/users/:id`, use `req.params.id` to capture the ID, such as for `/users/123`.

### Code Example: Request Data

Here is the Express.js server setup:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Endpoint to capture query string parameter
app.get('/query', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.query);
  res.send('Received your query param!');
});

// Endpoint to capture URL parameter
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.params);
  res.send('Received your URL param!');
});

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on port ${port}!`));
```
<br>

## 14. Describe the purpose of `req.body` and how you would access it.

In an Express.js application, `req.body` is a property of the **HTTP request object** that contains data submitted through an HTTP POST request.

The POST request might originate from an HTML form, a client-side JavaScript code, or another API client. The data in `req.body` is typically structured as a JSON object or a URL-encoded form.

### Middleware and Parsing Request Body

The `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` middleware parse incoming `Request` objects before passing them on. These middlewares populate `req.body` with the parsed JSON and URL-encoded data, respectively.

Here is an example of how you might set up body parsing in an Express app:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Parse JSON and URL-encoded data into req.body
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

### Accessing `req.body` Data

Once the body parsing middleware is in place, you can access the parsed data in your **route handling** functions:

- **POST** or **PUT** Requests: When a client submits a POST or PUT request with a JSON payload in the request body, you can access this data through `req.body`.

Here is an example:

Client-side JavaScript:

```javascript
fetch('/example-route', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ key: 'value' })
});
```

Server-side Express route handler:

```javascript
app.post('/example-route', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // Outputs: { key: 'value' }
});
```

- **HTML Forms**: When a form is submitted using `<form>` with `action` pointing to your Express route and `method` as POST or PUT, and the form fields are input elements within the form, `req.body` will contain these form field values.

Here is an example:

HTML form:

```html
<form action="/form-endpoint" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="username" />
  <input type="password" name="password" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Express route:

```javascript
app.post('/form-endpoint', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body.username, req.body.password);
});
```

A modern technique for sending form data using `fetch` is by setting the `Content-Type` header to `'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'` and using the `URLSearchParams` object:

```javascript
fetch('/form-endpoint', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  },
  body: new URLSearchParams({ username: 'user', password: 'pass' })
});
```

- **Custom Parsers**: While Express provides built-in body parsers for JSON and URL-encoded data, you might receive data in another format. In such cases, you can create custom middleware to parse and shape the data as needed. This middleware should populate `req.body`.
<br>

## 15. How do you create a _middleware_ that logs the _request method_ and _URL_ for every request?

In Express.js, **middlewares** allow you to handle HTTP requests. Here, you will learn how to create a simple **logging middleware** that records the request method and URL.

### Setting Up the Express App

First, install Express via npm, and set up your `app.js` file:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
```

### Creating the Logging Middleware

Define a logging function that extracts the request method and URL, and then use `app.use()` to mount it as middleware.

```javascript
// Logging Middleware
const logRequest = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Received ${req.method}  request for: ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Call next to proceed to the next middleware
};

// Mount the middleware for all routes
app.use(logRequest);
```

### Testing the Setup

Use `app.get()` to handle GET requests, and `app.listen()` to start the server.

```javascript
// Sample route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

When you visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser and check the server console, you should see the request being logged.
